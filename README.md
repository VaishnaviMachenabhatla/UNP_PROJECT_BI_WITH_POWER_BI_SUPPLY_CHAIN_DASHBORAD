# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_SUPPLY_CHAIN_DATA

I collaborated with UNP on a Supply Chain Dashboard project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of inventory management and logistics. Our approach began with an in-depth analysis of the dataset, ensuring data consistency while importing raw data from Excel. We addressed missing or corrupted files, eliminated duplicate records, and implemented data validation rules to maintain accuracy. Additionally, we resolved inconsistencies, such as variations in supplier name spellings, to ensure uniformity.  
Since a data model was not required, we proceeded with the development of key performance metrics, including Total Revenue, Total Cost, and Total Profit. We then designed bar charts, pie charts, and donut charts to visualize insights, such as total revenue by product type and location, total sales distribution, shipping costs by carrier and transportation mode, defect rates, and inspection rates.  
To enhance user experience, we integrated dynamic slicers, drop-down lists, and interactive buttons for seamless navigation. These slicers enabled filtering by routes, customer demographics, product type, shipping carriers, and locations, making the dashboard more impactful. The dashboard also provided key insights into product performance, inventory and logistics management, and supplier quality control.  
Finally, we designed a clean, professional, and intuitive interface that facilitates data-driven decision-making, empowering businesses to optimize supply chain operations effectively.
